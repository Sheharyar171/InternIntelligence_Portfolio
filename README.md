# InternIntelligence_Portfolio
As part of my internship at Intern Intelligence, I was assigned to design and develop a complete personal portfolio website â€” and Iâ€™m proud to share that itâ€™s now fully live and functional!  ðŸ’¼ Purpose:  To create a portfolio that reflects both technical skill and design understanding â€” with a smooth user experience and responsive layout.
